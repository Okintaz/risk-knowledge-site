    <h1>Quantitative Risk Approach</h1>

    <p>
      Quantitative risk management represents a structured attempt to understand
      uncertainty using numerical techniques, probability theory, and statistical
      modeling. Within the ISO 31000 framework, quantitative analysis does not
      replace judgment or qualitative assessment, but enhances decision-making
      where uncertainty can be reasonably measured.
    </p>

    <p>
      Organizations typically apply quantitative methods when risk exposure is
      material, decisions are irreversible or long-term, and outcomes can be
      expressed in measurable terms such as financial loss, schedule delay, or
      capacity impact.
    </p>

    <!-- EXPECTED VALUE -->
    <h2>1. Expected Value (EV)</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Expected_value.png" alt="Expected value illustration">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Wikipedia — Expected Value  
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Expected Value is one of the most fundamental quantitative risk concepts.
      It represents the probability-weighted average of all possible outcomes.
      While deceptively simple, it forms the foundation of many advanced risk
      and decision models.
    </p>

    <p>
      In practical terms, Expected Value answers the question:
      <em>“If this uncertain situation were repeated many times, what would the
      average outcome be?”</em> This makes it particularly useful for comparing
      alternatives that involve trade-offs between risk and reward.
    </p>

    <p>
      Expected Value is widely used in project risk analysis, investment appraisal,
      insurance pricing, and operational decision-making. However, it must be
      interpreted carefully: two options can have the same expected value but
      very different risk profiles.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a governance perspective, Expected Value should be used alongside
      risk appetite and tolerance considerations. A decision with positive
      expected value may still be unacceptable if potential downside exceeds
      organizational tolerance.
    </p>

    <!-- SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS -->
    <h2>2. Sensitivity Analysis</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Sensitivity_analysis_tornado_diagram.png" alt="Sensitivity analysis tornado diagram">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Wikipedia — Sensitivity Analysis  
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Sensitivity analysis examines how changes in individual input variables
      affect an outcome, holding other factors constant. Its primary objective
      is not prediction, but understanding influence and vulnerability.
    </p>

    <p>
      In risk management practice, sensitivity analysis helps identify
      “risk drivers” — variables that disproportionately affect outcomes.
      This insight allows organizations to focus mitigation, controls, and
      monitoring efforts on the most critical assumptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tornado diagrams are commonly used to visualize sensitivity results,
      ranking variables by their impact. These visuals are especially effective
      in executive and board-level discussions, where clarity and prioritization
      are essential.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sensitivity analysis is most valuable in early planning stages, when
      assumptions are uncertain and decisions are still flexible. It is often
      used as a precursor to more advanced simulation techniques.
    </p>

    <!-- SCENARIO ANALYSIS -->
    <h2>3. Scenario Analysis</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Scenario_analysis_diagram.png" alt="Scenario analysis example">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Wikipedia — Scenario Analysis  
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_analysis
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Scenario analysis evaluates outcomes under a set of internally consistent
      assumptions representing different possible futures. Unlike sensitivity
      analysis, which isolates variables, scenario analysis considers how
      multiple factors may interact.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scenarios are often framed as best-case, base-case, and worst-case outcomes,
      but more sophisticated applications may involve macroeconomic, geopolitical,
      climate, or regulatory scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      Scenario analysis plays a critical role in strategic planning, enterprise
      risk management, and regulatory stress testing. It supports resilience by
      helping organizations anticipate and prepare for uncertainty beyond
      historical experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Importantly, scenario analysis encourages structured thinking about
      uncertainty and avoids false precision. It is as much a communication
      and learning tool as it is a quantitative technique.
    </p>

    <!-- MONTE CARLO -->
    <h2>4. Monte Carlo Simulation</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="/images/Approximation_d'une_distribution_normale.gif" alt="Monte Carlo simulation distribution">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Wikipedia — Monte Carlo Method  - The approximation of a normal distribution with a Monte Carlo method 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Monte Carlo simulation represents one of the most powerful tools in
      quantitative risk analysis. Rather than relying on single-point estimates,
      it models uncertainty by running thousands (or millions) of simulations
      using probability distributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output of a Monte Carlo simulation is not a single number, but a
      distribution of possible outcomes. This allows decision-makers to
      understand likelihood, confidence levels, and tail risks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in portfolio risk management,
      capital projects, energy markets, insurance, and quantitative finance.
      It is especially useful when multiple uncertain variables interact
      in non-linear ways.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Monte Carlo results are only as reliable as the assumptions
      and input distributions used. Governance, transparency, and expert
      judgment are essential to avoid false confidence.
    </p>

    <!-- VAR -->
    <h2>5. Value at Risk (VaR)</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="/images/value-at-risk.webp" alt="Value at Risk distribution">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Corporate Finance Institue — Value at Risk (VaR) 
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Value at Risk (VaR) estimates the maximum expected loss over a specified
      time horizon at a given confidence level. It has become a standard risk
      metric in financial institutions and regulatory frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
      VaR is attractive because it condenses complex risk exposure into a
      single, communicable number. This makes it useful for senior management,
      regulators, and risk committees.
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite its popularity, VaR has limitations. It does not describe losses
      beyond the confidence threshold and can underestimate tail risk if
      distributions are mis-specified.
    </p>

    <p>
      Best practice requires VaR to be complemented by stress testing,
      scenario analysis, and qualitative judgment.
    </p>

    <!-- STRESS TEST -->
    <h2>6. Stress Testing</h2>

    <div class="figure">
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Stress_testing_financial_risk.png" alt="Stress testing financial risk">
      <div class="caption">
        Source: Wikipedia — Stress Testing  
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_test_(financial)
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>
      Stress testing evaluates the impact of extreme but plausible adverse
      events on an organization’s financial, operational, or strategic position.
      Unlike probabilistic models, stress testing focuses on severity and
      resilience rather than likelihood.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is widely used by regulators, financial institutions, and boards to
      assess preparedness for systemic shocks, economic crises, or operational
      disruptions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Effective stress testing challenges assumptions, exposes vulnerabilities,
      and supports contingency planning. It is a critical complement to
      quantitative models that rely on historical data.
    </p>

    <h2>Perspective</h2>

    <p>
      Quantitative risk methods enhance understanding of uncertainty, but they
      do not eliminate it. 
      
      When applied responsibly — in alignment with ISO 31000,
      sound governance, and professional judgment — they significantly strengthen
      risk-informed decision-making in corporate objectives.
