<h1>Risk Management Implementation Around the World</h1>

<p>
Risk management is implemented globally across industries
such as finance, infrastructure, energy, healthcare, and
technology. While approaches vary, the core principles
remain consistent.
</p>

<h2>Project & Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Large infrastructure projects use risk management to address
cost overruns, schedule delays, safety risks, and regulatory
compliance.
</p>

<h2>Financial & Investment Institutions</h2>
<p>
Banks and investment firms apply risk management to credit,
market, liquidity, and operational risks to protect capital
and maintain stability.
</p>

<h2>Public Sector & Government</h2>
<p>
Governments adopt enterprise risk management frameworks
to improve policy decisions, service delivery, and
crisis preparedness.
</p>

<p>
Across regions, effective implementation depends on
leadership commitment, risk culture, and continuous
monitoring.
